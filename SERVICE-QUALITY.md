- Line length violations in some docstrings
- Minor whitespace in blank lines

#### Type Checking (~35 mypy issues)
- Some missing type parameters on generics
- Optional improvements to complex signatures

#### Dependencies (39 outdated)
- Multiple packages have updates available
- Not critical for functionality

## How to Use Quality Commands

This service has its own quality management:

```bash
# Check current quality status
make quality-check

# Auto-fix what's possible
make quality-fix

# Generate detailed report
make quality-report

# Format code
make format

# Run linting
make lint

# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov
```

## Service Independence

This service maintains complete independence:
- ✅ Own quality-check.sh script
- ✅ Own Makefile with quality commands
- ✅ Own pyproject.toml configuration
- ✅ Own test suite with 63% coverage
- ✅ Own dependencies (requirements.txt)
- ✅ Own PostgreSQL database (product_catalog_db)
- ✅ No shared libraries with other services

## Key Files Changed

### Route Files (FastAPI Pattern Updates)
- `src/api/routes/products.py` - Updated to use Annotated
- `src/api/routes/categories.py` - Updated to use Annotated
- `src/api/routes/health.py` - Updated to use Annotated

### Core Modules (Import Structure)
- `src/core/*.py` - Fixed relative imports

- `src/repositories/*.py` - Fixed relative imports

## Next Steps

### Optional Improvements
1. Update non-critical dependencies (research compatibility first)
2. Fix remaining line length issues in docstrings
3. Add missing type annotations for complete type safety
4. Increase test coverage from 63% to 80%

### Maintenance
1. Run `make quality-check` before each commit
2. Use `make quality-fix` to maintain code standards
3. Monitor quality-report.md for trends
